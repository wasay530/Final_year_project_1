# Project Overview

Person localization and crowd sourcing in aerial
Images is a challenging problem and of great interest in many
applications such as crowd safety and security management,
people management in disasters, and person movement in an
epidemic disease situation. However, the Ariel images have an
issue of cluttered background, low-resolution quality, and various
environment and lighting conditions, which increase complexity
levels of localization and recognition. In this paper, we propose
deep learning and a UAV Raspberry Pi-based platform for the
acquisition and localization of crowds considering the different
orientations of the UAV and heterogeneous environmental fac-
tors. We focus on implementing object location and recognition
with various constraints. The proposed system consists of: the
transfer of the image from the UAV to the processing system,
image enhancement, features extraction for object detection and
recognition, and performance comparison of different detection
and recognition algorithms. We collect a large local environment
dataset for better accuracy. We compare the performance of
Haar-Cascade, template matching, YOLO, and convolutional
neural network. The aforementioned results show that YOLO
performs better for crowd detection and localization.
